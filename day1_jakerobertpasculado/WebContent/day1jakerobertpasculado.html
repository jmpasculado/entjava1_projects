<td>Intro<br>
It was another day in the barren landscape of Pandora. 
A land scaved by thousands of years of warfare. 
The desolate landscape is govern by the dead and dry sands.
Reclaimed by the scorched radiation that looms across the soil.
The sky hazing with a deep orange glow, like an hour till dusk.
All around is a small fog that slowly floats around making visibility,
a bit challenging.

 to see for survivors of any groups or factions and in the same time finding 
 resources to use, after a long day of searching he has found a small

<td>Afternoon<br>
Arnold out of his curiosity goes near the house, slowly opening the doors.
As he sticks out his gun and a keen sense of foresight. He was surprised
that very cooled metallic barrel sticks in his neck. Aware of a gun being
pointed at him, he suddenly flinched his arm to disarm the gun from the 
person and pointed the gun at the person in desperation. The person begged
for life because of the fear. Arnold with a heart of a man slowly puts away
the gun to test for any danger. The person slowly relieved and introduces
with hesitation.

The person that was in front of Arnold was a girl named Fiona, she was a
clinic doctor from a far town that was over ran by bandits. She never had
any experience in killing but her expertise in being a doctor made her
a vital part of any team. Arnold and Fiona was getting along with small
talk making them comfortable that they were in the same boat. They agreed
on moving out of the house to search for others, with a bag of weapons, ammo,
, rations and medical supplies they were ready to search on the dangers
of Pandora during the long night.

Pandora was also known by many as a long night planet for its really long and 
unending like darkness that shrouds the landscape in peach black. Making visibility
absolute zero without any light sources. The long night goes about for 18 hours.
The sun slowly vanishes from the dumpsite leaving Arnold and Fiona with a hand torch
to guide them, along the way a narrow path was being taken by another individual named
Martin an all around Engineer. Martin was being chased by crazy bandits heading to the
direction of Arnold and Fiona. As they crossed paths. Martin hid on the rumble
leaving Arnold with the stand off with the Bandits, from there the hours followed
the long fight between Arnold and the Bandits taking shots from one another. Fiona can 
also see Martin from a distance being injured, and is willing to aid him.
